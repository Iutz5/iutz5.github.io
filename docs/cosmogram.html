        <h2>What does this mean in the context of the Kongo culture?</h2>
        <p id = "first">In the Kongo culture, this depicts the physical world from the spiritual world.</p>
        <p id = "second">The cosmogram represents the journey of the human soul, the intersection between the living the and dea, and the cyclical nature of existance</p>

        <h2>What does this have to do with the banjo?</h2>
        <p>Africans incorporated elements of the Kongo cosmogram into their cultural expressions, particularly in music and dance, as a means of resistance and preservation</p>
        <p>Through dance, music, and symbolic gestures, Africans conveyed messages and maintained connections to their heritage</p>
        <h3>Connections to ancestors</h3>
        <p>It was common in Kongo religion to make a physical safe-ground for their ancestors. This was mostly done in the form of pottery, particularly having spirits reside in jars and containers</p>
        <p>The banjo was originally designed to hold as a resting place for spiritual ancestors in the physical world, allowing for celebration through music and dance with the members of the physical world and members of the spirtual world</p>

        <h2>So how did these traditions and cultural practices get brought into the Americas?</h2>
        <p>The Kongo's religious traditions were mostly conversed through stories and tales. The listeners to these stories got taken away from their families in the 18th century, when the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade was at its peak. Slavery is the Americas was necessary at the time for large agricultural and economic success</p>

        <h2>Slaves living on the plantations</h2>
        <p>The conditions for the slaves was extremely harsh. This was mostly due to slaveowners fearing of being overthrown by their slaves, since most slaveowners had a large number of slaves per acre</p>
        <p>This fear put restrictions onto the slaves, including no verbal communcation, which forced the slaves to have to communicate through dance and body movement; something that was largely practiced in the Kongo culture as means of celebration</p>
