    <section id="Original_Banjo_Construction">
        <h2>So what were the original banjos made out of?</h2>
        <p id="obc1">The main part of the instrument, the body, was made out of a hollowed-out gourd or calabash, which are fruits. This provided a resonant chamber for the sound and were dried to enforce durability</p>
        <p id="obc2">The head of the banjo, which is the white, circular part, was made of animal skin, usually goat, calf, or sheep. The skin was strecthed tightly over the open end of the gourd and secured in place.</p>
        <p id="obc3">The strings were either made from plant fibers or animal gut. To make thicker strings, the fibers were twisted together to make varied pitches</p>

    <section id="Changes">
        <h2>So why did they change depending on the area?</h2>
        <p id="c1">A lot of places had different styles of resources that makers had to adapt their construction of the instrument to meet the resources that were provided</p>
        <p id="c2">As European and African cultures began to integrate due to shared space, intermingling populations, and mutual exchange of musical practice, the structure of the banjo began to change to include both cultures. This introduced the construction of the banjo to different resources that weren't used before, such as adding metal for tuning pegs</p>

    <section id="Different_names">
        <h2>There were many different names for the banjo, depending on the region that it was constructed. Some include: </h2>

    <section id="Strum-strumps">
        <h2>Commonly known as the first "modern banjo" the strum-strumps were first introduced in Jamacia in the late 17th Century by Johnathan Sloane</h2>
        <p id="ss1">Strum-strumps are described as plucked spike lutes that include a drum-like body, a full-spike neck that goes through the body, a flat, fretless fingerboard, and wooden friction pegs</p>
        <p id="ss2">Originally depicted with two strings, strum-strumps also include extra holes on the fingerboards, indicating a potential for three-string configurations similar to West African instruments. These additional holes suggest the use of multiple thumb-string pegs for tuning in different keys, likely to prevent breakage due to excessive tension on the thumb-string.</p>

    <section id="transition_to_minstrelsy">
        <h2>So what resulted from this appropriation?</h2>
        <p>Although some exchanges between European and African cultures were mutually beneficial, such as African Americans adopting European instruments and music styles, such as the fiddle, guitar, and songs, and Anglo-Americans adopting elements from African American music, including the banjo, banjo songs, and dance practices like patting juba and the hoedown, there were a lot of negative effects of this appropriation, including downplay or dismiss the contributions of African Americans.</p> 
        <p>This was often fueled by racism and classism, with African American musical practices being labeled as inferior or insignificant by societal elites. Minstrelsy often misrepresented and caricatured African American traditions, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and erasing the true origins of many musical forms. </p>
