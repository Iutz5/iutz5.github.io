        <h2>Economic Boom</h2>
        <p>The rise of minstrelsy fueled a significant expansion in the entertainment industry, particularly in the realm of music, by introducing elements of African American culture such as blues and jazz. This cultural infusion provided economic opportunities that were largely seized upon by white entrepreneurs and performers.</p>

        <h2>Whites creation of African American Instruments</h2>
        <p>There are some differences between the original banjo, such as the strum-strumps Johnathan Sloane found in Jamaica and our idea of the "modern day" banjo, such as the 5-stringed boucher banjo. Some differences include: </p>
        <ul id="w1"> African Banjo
            <li>Body typically made from a gourd or calabash</li>
            <li>Skin membrane stretched over the body</li>
            <li>Wooden neck</li>
            <li>Strings crafted from materials like gut or plant fibers</li>
        </ul>
        <ul id="w2"> Boucher Banjo
            <li>Round wooden body, often made of maple</li>
            <li>Metal rim and tension hoop for stability</li>
            <li>Skin head for resonance</li>
            <li>Neck with frets and tuning pegs made of metal</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emegrence of Machine Creation</h2>
        <p id="m1">Since African American instruments, particularly the banjo, was so successful and had such a high demand in the late 19th to mid 20th century, whites wanted to get as much money as they could from these instruments</p>
        <p id="m2">Mass producing allows for banjos to be bought worldwide, allowing for there to be more shops that have a banjo available for purchase</p>
        <p id="m3">This also allows for there to be a removal of any human-error, since everything is machine-produced</p>
        <p id="m4">Therefore, every banjo is made exactly the same which makes the banjo completely lose its original intent; that is, the story of the creator and sharing the experience of celebration between earthly and ethereal spirits</p>
