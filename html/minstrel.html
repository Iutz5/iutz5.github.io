        <h2>Curious...but mean</h2>
        <p>Although some people were genuinely curious about the African culture and the music and dance that is portrayed, the majority of people sought the African dance and music as a form of comedy </p>

    <section id="Blackface">
        <h2>Blackface</h2>
        <p id="b1">White performers in Western Europe and Americas in the 19th century would paint their face and skin black to imitate the physical representations of a stereotypical black man </p>
        <p id="b2">This was seen as comedy, mocking the African American culture, since many people who went to the blackface shows did not approve of the recent changes in emancipation for African Americans that was caused by changes in legislation such as the Emancipation Proclamation in the United States and the Slavery Abolition Act in England </p>

        <h2>Misrepresentation of the instrument</h2>
        <p id="im1">When whites began to impersonate the lives of African Americans, they did so with the intent of mocking their culture and practices.</p>
        <p id="im2">Remember that the banjo was originally constructed as a celebratory instrument to connect the earthly beings with their ethereal ancestors.</p>
        <p id="im3">Because of this mockery, the whites either did not know or did not care about the religious perspective of the instrument, thus beginning to lose the vary intent for the creation of the instrument</p>
        <p id="im4">Since minstrelsy boomed the entertainment industry, particularly musically with the introduction to African American roots such as blues and jazz, white people saw this as an economic boom</p>
    </section>
    <section id="positivity">
        <h2>Not all bad..?</h2>
        <p id="p1">Even though minstrelsy induced racism, exploitation, and perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, it is important to note that there were some positives in the effects of minstrelsy for African Americans and their culture</p>
        <p id="p2">There were many African Americans who were actors in minstrel shows and performed blackface themselves as a way to make economic profit, even if that meant hurting one's own heritage</p>
        <p id="p3">The instrumentation that was brought over from Africa during the Transatlantic Slave Trade was introduced in many shows, allowing for whites to experience African music and timbre for the first time. This sparked curiosity for whites to learn more about African culture and some whites even gained an appreciation for different lifestyles</p>
